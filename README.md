> What we got goin'on

This is a gallery of thumbnail images to allow us to see all the the entities in our business landscape.

The current setup gives us a clean separation of concerns while still being simple to use.

- index.html - Contains the structure and the data
- index.css - Handles all the styling
- index.js - Manages the gallery functionality

The gallery features we've implemented:

- Responsive flexbox layout
- Image popups with Fancybox
- Clickable titles that open in new tabs
- Clean hover effects
- Ellipsis for long titles
- Proper spacing and shadows
